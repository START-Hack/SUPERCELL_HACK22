Case Introduction:

Over the past three years we’ve seen more of our social lives being experienced online. Whether it be our learning, work, hanging out with friends and family, playing, or even just escaping from the daily grind. The problem is that, generally speaking, we’re still learning how to act online. It’s easier, when online, to offer a version of yourself, or even to present yourself completely differently than you might in real life. It’s also easier to miss how your actions impact those around you. 

In the physical social societies that we typically occupy, we’ve learned to understand how our actions impact others. Sometimes it’s in obvious ways; for example, we see someone authentically laugh at something funny we say, or share our pain and sadness when we experience hardships. We also have learned to read how what we say might affect someone else; for example, if we say something hurtful, we see that person react and, if we have learned our lessons about being a good person, we can change our tone to try and resolve any tension or hurt created by our words. We experience social with an evolved set of tools that range from what we can see to even the sense or intuition we experience when interacting with others. 

In the digital social societies that we have increasingly occupied–spaces like a Supercell game–we experience social with a basic set of tools, adding also that we sometimes come to digital spaces with a persona that isn’t fully worked out yet. 

All this to say, we need to find ways to synthetically augment the sorts of connections humans have come to develop organically.

Further Information: 

We moved from a global pandemic to major European conflict overnight. Society is fatigued, and we see the ever-increasing tribalisation unfolding online. This challenge is not just about making digital society nicer, it’s about improving all of society by fighting against what seems to be the worst of our natural instincts to fight with strangers online. This is not technology we hope to see manifest in the future because it’s good for business, this is technology that is already needed to humanity. 

The Challenge: Synthesising Empathy

Create technology that provides digital societies with a greater sense of impact had by the way we act and by how we communicate. This may act as a form of synthesized-empathy or augmented reactions to better convey how someone is feeling. It may utilize some form of AI or ML to either provide assistance to the sender or the receiver of communications, or it may act as something omni-present within the community to help guilde it along. Really, there is so much space here to find and solve any of the hundreds of tiny problems that persist in making digital societies feel less humane than physical societies. We need everything from better education to better policy, to better technology in order to make gains here. 

Judging Criteria:

We’re looking for something truly innovative, but it doesn’t need to be complex. We’re also looking for something that augments, not necessarily something that in completely novel. While Supercell is a gaming studio, the winning project doesn’t necessarily need to focus on gaming. Rather, it could be as focused as gaming, or as wide as online social. The main areas we’ll be looking at are:
Does the project augment a social experience to improve how people interact with each other?
Does the project take into consideration products that are already on the market (consider looking up chat filter companies and machine learning solutions for combatting “toxic users”).
Does this project demonstrate an understanding of how people interact, and capture that humanity?
Could this project scale, given the right time, talent, and resources?

Nathan, Lucas, or Ilari will be glad to answer your questions during the Deep Dive. We’ll also be available on Discord.
